        "description": "EVERCLUB is a decentralised platform based on smart contracts. Through smart contracts of the BSC network, users are rewarded in the respective cryptocurrencies for expanding their team and increasing the number of EverClub participants. The code of all contracts is publicly available, as well as information about transactions in the BSC network."

      {
        "title": "What is smart contract? What is its advantage?",
        "description": "A smart contract is an algorithm within the cryptocurrency blockchain that automates the responsibilities within the system. In the case of EverClub, the contract eliminates the dominant role of the development team in controlling rewards and allows that role to be focused on technical support. The smart contract is responsible for distributing rewards to participants when the right conditions are fulfilled. Once created, a smart contract cannot be hacked or modified."

        "title": "What is different from a piramid?",
        "description": "A pyramid scheme involves one or more people at the top controlling all the income. At any time, they can press the \"take the money\" button and disappear. In EverClub, however, a smart contract manages all the rewards. At any given moment, the funds are in the wallets of the participants. No third parties are involved - blockchain ensures the integrity and transparency of the reward."
